# Data submission portal for plantspec

Welcome to the submission portal for the the plantspec dataset. Our goal is to build a community of data contributors in order to increase the general availability of spectral calibration data for NIRS. These goals are further described in XXX publication. We are focused on plant stoichiometric data, but also invite other data types (e.g., soils). We use a free data submission service, and so if you data exceed 500 MB, or if you have issues with the form, please simply email the files and information to griffith.dan@gmail.com. Thank you for contributing!
