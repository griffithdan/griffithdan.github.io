My research explores the relationships among plants, climate, and ecosystems, with a focus on grassland, savanna, and forest ecosystems. By integrating observations, experiments, ecological modeling, and large-scale data analysis, my work aims to unravel how human activities, fire regimes, and climate change shape plant communities and biodiversity. 

A key focus of my research is understanding the ecological strategies of plants and how their functional traits influence ecosystem dynamics across biogeographical scales. By bridging ecophysiology with community ecology and macroecology, I hope to improve Earth System Models (ESMs) by incorporating the diverse evolutionary and physiological strategies of grasses. My goal is to enhance predictions of ecosystem resilience under future climate scenarios and inform sustainable land management practices.

My research integrates a wide array of cutting-edge techniques, including field-based ecophysiological measurements, drone and satellite remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and ecological modeling. I utilize tools such as gas exchange systems, stable isotope analysis, and structural equation modeling to investigate plant functional traits and ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, I develop and apply species distribution models and phylogenetic statistical approaches to understand plant community patterns across spatial and temporal scales. This combination of fieldwork, remote sensing, and computational modeling enables me to address complex ecological questions about biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the impacts of environmental change.

I strive to cultivate an inclusive and collaborative research environment.
